1)Are the HTML tags and elements the same things?
  

- 
HTML tags and elements are related but not exactly the same things in HTML.

  HTML Tags: Tags are the fundamental building blocks of HTML syntax. They are used to define elements within an HTML document. 
  Tags usually come in pairs: an opening tag and a closing tag.
  HTML tags like <br>,<hr>,<img>,<link>,<mata>,<area>,<input>,<source> etc.
  
  HTML Elements: Elements are made up of tags, along with the content they enclose.
  HTML elements like <p>.....</p>, etc.

2)What are tags and attributes in HTML?

- In HTML tags and attributes are fundamental components used to define and structure web documents.

  element is written in angle brackets which is known as tags.
  They are enclosed in angle brackets '< >' and are used to define elements within an HTML document.
  '<p>' is the opening tag.
  
'</p>' is the closing tag. 

  attribute is use to define the characteristics on an HTML element and is placed inside the element opening tag.
  for major attributeused : class,id,title,style.
  Example : <body bgcolor="red">.

3)What are void elements in HTML? With Example.

- 

Void elements in HTML are elements that do not have any content or closing tag. 
  They are self-closing tags and do not have any child elements or text nodes. 
  Void elements are defined by the HTML specification to only include the start tag and optional attributes.

  Example : <hr>,<br>,<img>,<link>,<mata>,<area>,<base>,<input>,<source> etc.

4)What are HTML Entities? With Example.

- 
T
HTML entities are special codes used to represent characters that have special meaning in HTML, 
  or characters that cannot easily be typed or rendered by normal keyboard input. 
  
  HTML entities are written using an ampersand (&) followed by a specific code or name, and ending with a semicolon (;).
  There are two types of HTML entities: named entities and numeric entities.

  Named entities are easier to remember and use descriptive names to represent characters.
  Named Entities Example : &lt; - Represents the less-than sign '<'.
                           &gt; - Represents the greater-than sign '>'.
           		   &amp; - Represents the ampersand '&'.
            		   
&quot; - Represents the double quotation mark '"'.

  Numeric entities represent characters using their Unicode code points. They are written as '&#' followed by the decimal code point and ending with ';'.
  Numeric Entities Example : '&#169;' - Represents the copyright symbol '©'.  
 			     '&#8364;' - Represents the euro sign '€'.

5)What are different types of Lists in HTML? With Example.

- There is a three type of lists.
  1. order list
  2. unorder list
  3. description list

  1. order list :  An ordered list represents a list of items where each item is sequentially numbered or ordered.
                   Each item in an ordered list is wrapped in '<li>' (list item) tags. 
		   Example : <ol type="," start="28">
				<li> list 1 </li>
			     </ol>
  
  2. unorder list : An ordered list type is disc(default),circle,square.
                    Like ordered lists, each item in an unordered list is wrapped in '<li>' tags.
		    Example : <ul type="square">
				 <li> list 1 </li>
			      </ul>
 				
  3. description list : A definition list consists of terms (defined by '<dt>' tags) and their definitions (defined by '<dd>' tags). 
			This type of list is typically used to display glossaries, dictionaries, or other collections of name-value pairs.
			Example : <dl>
				 	<dt> html </dt>
					<dd> is a markeup language </dd>
				  </dl>

6)What is the "class" attribute in HTML? With Example.

- In HTML, the "class" attribute is used to specify one or more class names for an element. 
  Classes are used in conjunction with CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) to apply styling to elements or to group elements with similar characteristics.
  Classes are defined in CSS using a period ('.') followed by the class name. 
  In HTML, the 'class' attribute is used to apply a class to an element. You can apply multiple classes to an element by separating them with spaces.
  Example : .head1{
		color : red;
	    }
	    .head2{
		color : green;
	    }

	    <body>
		<h1 class = "head1">Headding 1</h1>  
		<h1 class = "head2">Headding 2</h1>
	    </body>

7)What is the difference between the 'id' attribute and the 'class attribute of HTML Elements? With Example.

- In HTML, the 'id' and 'class' attributes are used to assign identifiers to HTML elements, but they serve different purposes and have different rules for usage.
  
  id attribute :  The 'id' attribute is used to uniquely identify a single HTML element.
   		  The 'id' attribute is used to uniquely identify a single HTML element.
		  Commonly used for targeting a specific element with CSS, JavaScript, or when linking to a specific part of the page.
                  Example : <style>
				#p1{
					color : red;
				}
				#p2{
					color : blue;
				}
			    </style>
				
			    <body>
				<p id="p1">paragraph 1</p1>
				<p id="p2">paragraph 2</p1>
			    </body>
 
  class attribute : The 'class' attribute is used to classify multiple HTML elements into groups.
		    Multiple elements can share the same class value. An element can also have multiple classes
		    Example : .head1{
				color : red;
	   		      }
	   		     .head2{
				color : green;
	   		     }

	    		     <body>
				<h1 class = "head1">Headding 1</h1>  
				<h1 class = "head2">Headding 2</h1>
	    		     </body>

9)How is Cell padding different from Cell Spacing? With Example.

- Cell Padding

  	Cell padding refers to the space between the content of a cell and the cell's border. 
  	It essentially adds space inside each cell, making the content appear less cramped.

  Cell Spacing

	Cell spacing refers to the space between individual cells in a table. 
	It adds space outside the cells, separating them from each other.

	Example : <body>
			<table border=" 1 " style=" width: 450px;" cellpading = "10px" cellspacing= "10px" rules= "a11";
				<tr>
					<th>sr.no</th>
					<th>full name></th>
					<th>position></th>
					<th>salary></th>
				</tr>
			</table>
		  </body>

10)How can we club two or more rows or columns into a single row or column in an HTML table? With Example.

- To club two or more rows or columns into a single row or column in an HTML table, you use the 'rowspan' and 'colspan' attributes within the '<td>' or '<th>' elements. 
  
  colspan : is used to merge multiple columns into a single column. 
  rowspan : is used to merge multiple rows into a single row.

  Example : <table border = "1" style = "width: 300px;">
		<tr>
			<th rowspan = "2"></th> 
			<th calspan = "2">Average</th>
			<th rowspan = "2">red eyes</th>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<th> height</th>
			<th> weight</th>
		</tr>

11)What is the difference between a block-level element and an inline element?

- 
In HTML, block-level elements and inline elements serve different purposes and have distinct behaviors in how they are displayed and how they interact with other elements on a webpage. 
  Here are the key differences between them:

	1-Block-level Elements
  
 		
Display Characteristics:
			

Block-level elements occupy the entire width of their parent container by default, taking up a new line.

		Content Containment:


			They can contain other block-level elements and inline elements.

		Box Model:
			They can have a fixed width and height.
	
	Example :  <div>, <p>, <h1> - <h6>, <ul>, <ol>, <li>, <table>, <section>, <article>, and <footer>.

	2-Inline Elements

		
Display Characteristics:
			

Inline elements occupy only the space bounded by the tags defining the element.

		Content Containment:
			

They can contain only other inline elements or text.
 
		Box Model:
			

Respect only horizontal box model properties but ignore vertical properties.

	Example : <span>, <a>, <strong>, <em>, <img>, <br>, <i>, and <b>.

12)How to create an Hyperlink in HTML? With Example.

- Creating a hyperlink in HTML is done using the <a> (anchor) tag. 
  The href attribute within the <a> tag specifies the destination URL. 

  <a href="URL">Link Text</a>

  <body>
	<p>Visit <a href="https://www.openai.com">OpenAI</a> to learn more about AI.</p>
  </body>

  Additional Attributes

	1-
Target Attribute:


		Specifies where to open the linked document.
	
		
_blank: Opens the link in a new tab.
		
_self: Opens the link in the same frame.
		
_parent: Opens the link in the parent frame.
		
_top: Opens the link in the full body of the window.

	2-Title Attribute:
		

Provides additional information about the link, usually displayed as a tooltip when the mouse hovers over the link.

13)What is the use of an iframe tag? With Example.

- The <iframe> tag in HTML is used to embed another HTML document within the current document.
  It stands for "inline frame" and allows you to display content from another source, such as a different website or a different part of the same site, within a frame on the current page.

  Uses of <iframe>:

	1-
Embedding External Content:
		
Display content from another website within your own page.

	2-Including Documents or Media:
		
Embed documents, presentations, videos, maps, or other media files.

	3-Sandboxed Content:
		
Provide a sandboxed environment for running untrusted content securely.

	Example : <iframe src="url" frameborder="10" height="300px" width="500px"></iframe>

14)What is the use of a span tag? Explain With Example.

- The <span> tag in HTML is an inline container used to mark up a part of a text or a part of a document. 
  It does not inherently represent anything and is primarily used for styling and manipulating a specific portion of text or content with CSS or JavaScript.

  Uses of <span> Tag:

	1-
Styling Specific Parts of Text:
		
Apply specific CSS styles to a portion of text within a larger block.

	2-
JavaScript Manipulation:
		
Target specific portions of content for dynamic changes with JavaScript.

	3-
Grouping Inline Elements:
		
Group inline elements for styling or scripting purposes without affecting the document flow.

	Example : <style>
        
			.highlight {
           
				 color: red;
            
				 font-weight: bold;
        
		  }
    
		  </style>

		  <body>
			<p>This is an example of a paragraph with a <span class="highlight">highlighted</span> word.</p>
		  
</body>

15)How to insert a picture into a background image of a web page? With Example.

- we can set background attribute in the body tag to set an image as the background of the webpage.
  we will need to specify the url or the location of the image which we want to set to the background attribute of the body tag.

	Example : <style>
			p{
				background-image: url('img-girl.jpg');
			}
		  </style> 

16)How are active links different from normal link?

- Active links differ from normal (or inactive) links in several key ways, primarily in their state and behavior within a web page or application.

	State:
		
Normal Links:	

Default State:	These are the default state of links before any user interaction. 
				They appear as standard, unvisited links, often styled with default colors (e.g., blue for hyperlinks) and underline.

				Visited State:	After a user has clicked on a link and visited the linked page, the link may change color to indicate that it has been visited (typically purple). 
		
		Active Links:	

Active State: These are links in the process of being clicked.
			 	When a user clicks on a link and holds the mouse button down, the link enters an active state. 
				This state usually lasts only as long as the mouse button is held down.

	CSS Styling:
			
Normal Links:	

Styled using CSS pseudo-classes such as :link (for unvisited links) and :visited (for visited links).
				
				Example : a:link {
  
						color: blue;
					  
}
					  
a:visited {
  
						color: purple;
					  
}

			Active Links:

	Styled using the :active pseudo-class in CSS. 
					This pseudo-class applies styles during the time a link is being clicked.

				Example : a:active {
  
						color: red;
  
						background-color: yellow;
					  
} 

17)What are the different tags to separate section of text?

- <div>:
	

The <div> tag is a block-level element used to group together HTML elements to apply CSS styles or perform actions with JavaScript.
	
	Example : <div class="section">
  
			<p>This is a section of text.</p>
		  
</div>

  <p>:
	

The <p> tag is used to define a paragraph. 
	It is a block-level element that automatically adds some spacing before and after the text.

	Example : <p>This is a paragraph of text.</p>

  <h1> to <h6>:
	

The <h1> to <h6> tags are used to define headings, with <h1> being the highest level and <h6> the lowest. 
	They provide semantic meaning and help with the structure of the document.

	Example : <h1>Main Heading</h1>
		  
<h2>Subheading</h2>

  <section>:


	The <section> tag defines a section in a document, such as chapters, headers, footers, or any other sections of the document.

	Example : <section>
 
			 <h2>Section Title</h2>
 
			 <p>Content of the section.</p>
		  
</section>

  <article>:
	

The <article> tag specifies independent, self-contained content, which is often used for blog posts, news articles, or forum posts.
	
	Example : <article>
  
			<h2>Article Title</h2>
  
			<p>Content of the article.</p>
		  
</article>

  <nav>:
	

The <nav> tag defines a section of navigation links. 
	It is typically used for menus, tables of contents, or other navigational items.

	Example : <nav>
 
			 <ul>
   
			 <li><a href="#home">Home</a></li>
    
			 <li><a href="#about">About</a></li>
 
			 </ul>
		  
</nav>

  <aside>:
	

The <aside> tag defines content that is tangentially related to the content around it, such as sidebars, call-out boxes, or advertisements.

	Example : <aside>
  
			<p>This is an aside section.</p>
		  
</aside>

  <header>:
	

The <header> tag defines a header for a document or section, typically containing introductory content or navigational links.

	Example : <header>
  
			<h1>Website Title</h1>
  
			<nav>
    
				<a href="#home">Home</a>
   
				 <a href="#about">About</a>
  
			</nav>
			
</header>

  <footer>:
	

The <footer> tag defines a footer for a document or section, typically containing information about the author, copyright, links to related documents, etc.

	Example : <footer>
 
			 <p>&copy; 2024 My Website</p>
		  
</footer>

  <main>:
	

The <main> tag specifies the main content of a document. 
	There should only be one <main> element per document.

	Example : <main>
 
			 <h2>Main Content</h2>
 
			 <p>This is the main content of the document.</p>
		  
</main>

18)What is SVG?

- SVG : 

	
SVG stands for Scalable Vector Graphics.
	It is an XML-based format for describing two-dimensional vector graphics. 
	SVG is used to define graphics for the web, and it is a W3C recommendation.

  Example : cx and cy: The coordinates of the center of the circle.
	    
r: The radius of the circle.
	    
stroke: The color of the circle's outline.
	    
stroke-width: The width of the circle's outline.
	    
fill: The fill color of the circle.

	<svg height = "500px" width v= "100%">
		<rect x = "10" height = "100px" width = "100px" rx = "10px" ry = "10px"

		style = "fill : white; stroke : blue;
		stroke-width : 3px"></rect>

	<circle cx = "100" cy = "100" r = "50"
		style = "fill : white; stroke : blue;
		stroke-width : 3px"></circle>

	<line x1 = "200" y1 = "100" x2 = "300" y2 = "200"
		style = "fill : white; stroke : blue;
		stroke-width : 3px"></line>

19)What is the difference between HTML and XHTML?

- HTML (HyperText Markup Language) and XHTML (Extensible HyperText Markup Language) are both markup languages used for creating web pages, but they have some significant differences : 


	1-Syntax and Rules:



		HTML:	
Syntax is more lenient and forgiving.
			
Tags and attributes are case-insensitive.
			
Closing tags for some elements (e.g., <img>, <input>) are optional.
			
Attribute values can be unquoted if they do not contain spaces or special characters. 

		XHTML:	
Syntax is stricter and follows XML rules.
			
Tags and attributes are case-sensitive (typically lowercase).
			
All elements must be properly closed (e.g., <img />, <input />).
			
Attribute values must be quoted. 

	2-Compatibility:
		

		
HTML:	
Designed to be more flexible and tolerant of errors.
			
Browsers are designed to render HTML even if it contains errors.

		XHTML:	
Requires well-formed markup that adheres to XML rules.
			
Browsers must parse XHTML documents as XML, which means they will not render documents with errors.

20)What are logical and physical tags in HTML?

- In HTML, tags can be categorized into logical (semantic) and physical (presentational) tags.
  Understanding the difference between these two types of tags is important for creating well-structured and accessible web pages.

  Logical (Semantic) Tags :
 
	
Logical tags, also known as semantic tags, describe the meaning and structure of the content. 
  	They do not define how the content should be displayed but rather its role and importance within the document. 
  	These tags help improve the readability of the HTML code and enhance accessibility and SEO.
 
  Example : 1 - <header>: Defines a header section for a document or section.
	    2 - 
<nav>: Represents a section of the page that links to other pages or parts within the page (navigation links).
	    3 - 
<section>: Defines a section in a document.
	    4 - 
<article>: Represents a self-contained piece of content that can be independently distributed or reused.
	    5 - 
<aside>: Contains content that is tangentially related to the content around it (like sidebars).
	    6 - <footer>: Defines a footer for a document or section.
	    7 - 
<main>: Represents the main content of the document.
	    8 - 
<mark>: Highlights or marks text that is of special interest or relevance.
	    9 - 
<strong>: Indicates that the enclosed text is of strong importance or urgency.
	    10 - 
<em>: Stands for emphasis, which generally means that the enclosed text should be italicized.

  Physical Tags : 

	
Physical tags, also known as presentational tags, define the appearance of the content. 
	These tags are generally used to apply specific styles to content directly within the HTML document. 
	However, their use is discouraged in favor of CSS for styling, as using CSS separates content from presentation and enhances maintainability.

  Example : 1 - <b>: Makes the text bold.
	    2 - 
<i>: Italicizes the text.
	    3 - 
<u>: Underlines the text.
	    4 - 
<small>: Decreases the text size.
	    5 - 
<big>: Increases the text size.
	    6 - 
<sub>: Displays the text as subscript.
	    7 - 
<sup>: Displays the text as superscript.
	    8 - 
<tt>: Renders the text in a teletype or monospaced font.
	    9 - 
<strike>: Puts a strikethrough on the text.
	    10 - 
<font>: Defines font size, color, and face for the text.
